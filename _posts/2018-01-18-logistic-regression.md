Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm. It is used to predict a binary outcome given a set of independent variables. To represent binary / categorical outcome, we use dummy variables. You can also think of logistic regression as a special case of linear regression when the outcome variable is categorical, where we are using log of odds as dependent variable.
```python
